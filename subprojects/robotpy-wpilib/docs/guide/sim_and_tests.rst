Simulation and Testing
======================

An important (but often neglected) part of developing your robot code is to
test it! Because we feel strongly about testing and simulation, the RobotPy
project provides tools to make those types of things easier through the 
`pyfrc <https://github.com/robotpy/pyfrc>`_ project.

To get started, check out the `pyfrc documentation <http://pyfrc.readthedocs.org>`_.
