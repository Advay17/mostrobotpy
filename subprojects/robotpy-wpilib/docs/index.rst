RobotPy Documentation
=====================

Welcome to RobotPy! RobotPy is a community of FIRST mentors and students
dedicated to developing python-related projects for the FIRST Robotics
Competition.

This documentation site describes how to use the python version of WPILib. It
is a pure python implementation of WPILib, so that teams can use to write their
robot code in Python, a powerful dynamic programming language.

There is a lot of good documentation, but there's still room for improvement.
We welcome contributions from others!
